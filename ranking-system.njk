        <h2 id="overview">Overview: Accurate &amp; Fair Player Rankings for Street Fighter 6</h2>
        <p>
          Our FGC ranking system provides an accurate and current reflection of player skill and performance specifically for Street Fighter 6 (SF6). It ranks players based on their top results from sanctioned offline tournaments worldwide, rewarding consistent excellence and recent achievements. You can view the <a href="/rankings">current player rankings here</a>.
        </p>

        <h2 id="how-ranking-works">How the Ranking System Works</h2>
        <p>Our system is designed to fairly evaluate player performance by focusing on meaningful tournament results and ongoing competitive form.</p>

        <h3 id="placement-based-scoring">Placement-Based Scoring</h3>
        <p>Players earn points according to their final placement at offline tournaments. Higher placements receive significantly more points, ensuring that top finishes have the greatest impact on rankings.</p>

        <h3 id="best-performances-count">Best Performances Count</h3>
        <p>To balance quantity and quality, only each player’s five highest-rated performances are included in their overall ranking. This approach rewards consistent top-level play without favoring players who simply attend a large number of events.</p>

        <h3 id="dynamic-event-valuation">Dynamic Event Valuation</h3>
        <p>Each tournament's value is dynamically calculated based on multiple factors, including the prestige and history of the tournament, the strength of competition, and the prize money offered.</p>
        <p>Additional considerations include the diversity of regional participation and a focus on major tournaments that hold significant prominence within the competitive landscape.</p>
        <p>Larger, more prestigious tournaments with stronger player fields and higher stakes carry greater weight in the ranking system. This ensures that success at the most competitive and meaningful events is appropriately rewarded.</p>

        <h3 id="recency-bias">Recency Bias for Current Form</h3>
        <p>The system emphasizes recent tournament results to ensure the rankings accurately represent who is performing best right now. Older results gradually have less influence, keeping the leaderboard fresh and relevant.</p>

        <h3 id="offline-events">Offline Events Only</h3>
        <p>Rankings are based exclusively on sanctioned offline tournaments. Sanctioned tournaments are offline events that meet specific standards for fairness and competitive integrity.</p>

        <h3 id="data-sources">Data Sources &amp; Verification</h3>
        <p>We prioritize accurate and reliable data collection from trusted tournament organizers and verified results to maintain the integrity of the rankings. Our commitment ensures that player standings reflect genuine competitive performance.</p>

        <h3 id="global-recognition">Global Recognition &amp; Tournament Inclusion</h3>
        <p>Our ranking system recognizes offline fighting game tournaments from around the world, promoting a diverse and comprehensive competitive landscape.</p>
        <p>Tournament organizers interested in having their events evaluated for inclusion in the official list of rated tournaments are encouraged to contact us for consideration.</p>

        <h3 id="updates-transparency">Regular Updates, Community Transparency &amp; Engagement</h3>
        <p>Rankings are updated regularly to incorporate the latest tournament results, ensuring the leaderboard remains accurate and timely.</p>
        <p>Developed by and for the fighting game community, our ranking algorithms and weighting factors are designed to fairly recognize performance, consistency, and current competitive form.</p>
